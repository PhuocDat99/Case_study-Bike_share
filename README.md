# Project: Cyclistic Bike Share Customer Analytics Case Study
### Business Problem: 
Cyclistic wants to understand how members and casual riders differ in their bike usage and determine strategies to convert casual riders to annual memberships.
### Data: 
I downloaded over a year of historical bike trip data from Motivate International, containing fields like ride duration, date/time, member information and more.
### Data Preparation: 
I imported the CSV data files into Excel and added a column to calculate ride durations in HH:MM:SS format. Another column indicated the day of week as a number. I merged the monthly files into a single dataset.
### Data Cleaning: 
I inspected the data for errors, outliers and missing values. A small number of records were dropped due to issues. Data types were checked to ensure proper formatting.
### Analysis Steps:
- I calculated summary statistics, maximums and averages to get an initial sense of the data.
- Using pivot tables, I compared average ride durations between members and casual users as well as across weekdays.
- To discover trends over time, I also generated pivot charts segmented by month.
### Visualization: 
In Excel, I created dashboards containing visuals like bar charts, line charts to tell the story of my findings in an accessible way for executives
### Key Findings: 
Casual ride much longer on average than member users. The number of rides is especially high during rush hour thanks to the use of members.
### My top recommendations to Cyclistic included targeted membership promotions on weekends, incentivizing longer leisurely rides, and incentivizing ridership during shoulder seasons.
