# Project: Cyclistic Bike Share Customer Analytics Case Study
Business Problem: Cyclistic wants to understand how members and casual riders differ in their bike usage and determine strategies to convert casual riders to annual memberships.
Data: I downloaded over a year of historical bike trip data from Motivate International, containing fields like ride duration, date/time, member information and more.
Data Preparation: I imported the CSV data files into Excel and added a column to calculate ride durations in HH:MM:SS format. Another column indicated the day of week as a number. I merged the monthly files into a single dataset.
Data Cleaning: I inspected the data for errors, outliers and missing values. A small number of records were dropped due to issues. Data types were checked to ensure proper formatting.
Analysis Steps:
I calculated summary statistics, maximums and averages to get an initial sense of the data.
Using pivot tables, I compared average ride durations between members and casual users as well as across weekdays.
To discover trends over time, I also generated pivot charts segmented by month.
Visualization: In Excel, I created dashboards containing visuals like bar charts, line charts to tell the story of my findings in an accessible way for executives
Key Findings: Casual ride much longer on average than member users. The number of rides is especially high during rush hour thanks to the use of members.
My top recommendations to Cyclistic included targeted membership promotions on weekends, incentivizing longer leisurely rides, and incentivizing ridership during shoulder seasons.
